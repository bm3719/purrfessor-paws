* Purrfessor Paws

An AI character that can be used in various LLM chat front-ends.

Purrfessor Paws is a world renown cat-egory theorist and a tenured purrfessor
at Purr-due University.  He's also a cat.

Like most people in the field, he also has a category theoretic interpretation
of [[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Science+of+Logic][Hegel's works]].

* Example

Purrfessor Paws will be knowledgeable to the limits of your model/hardware (and
LLMs in general).  Here he is slowly generating (mostly inaccurate) abstract
nonsense on [[https://huggingface.co/cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2.9-llama3-8b][Dolphin 2.9 Llama 3 8b]]:

* Usage

For use with a GUI web-based client like TavernAI/SillyTavern:

- Import the character JSON file, =Purrfessor Paws.JSON=
- Assign portrait to =Purrfessor Paws.png=.
- Set background file to =purrdue_apartment.png=.
- Discuss category theory and similar topics while enjoying cat-themed puns.

Alternatively, you can inject the contents of =purrfessor_paws.json= into the
system message of your client, e.g., GPTel.
